## Architecture
Gravitalia is separated into two folders to facilitate the [microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices). Here is a description of the two files:

| Name | Readme | Description |
|------------|------------|------------|
| Rest | [readme](rest/README.md) | Gravitalia's main API that allows you to delete your account, obtain data, add photos... |
| Recommendation | [readme](recommendation/README.md) | Recommendation system based on several algorithms and [Memgraph](https://memgraph.com/) |

## Use the code
To use the code efficiently, you can download the docker-compose.yml and type `docker-compose up`.

‚ö†Ô∏è Check if [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed ‚ö†Ô∏è
